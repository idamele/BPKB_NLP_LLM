I’m developing a Knowledge Base representing a Business Process about a home-delivery pizza shop.
Given the text:

"My business, PizzaPazza, is a home delivery pizza shop. The customer fills in the order and then submits it to the shop, with the payment, by using our web-site. Making good pizzas requires good quality dough, produced in-house, and careful baking of the pizza. To make clients happy, we need to quickly fulfill the order and the delivery-boy needs to know the streets and how to speedily reach the customer’s address. Mary, the customer, connects to the PizzaPazza web-site and places her order of two Napoli pizzas, providing also the payment. On the arrival of Mary’s order at PizzaPazza, John, the cook, puts the order on the worklist. When Mary’s turn arrives, John prepares the ordered pizzas, cooks them, and then alerts the delivery-boy Eddy to come and pick up the pizzas. Thus, Eddy collects the pizzas and starts his delivery trip, eventually achieving the delivery to Mary’s home."
